## Interview Prep:
We looked at 2 problems this week:

### [Majority Element][1]:
Jay presented this problem to Keller.
#### Problem Statement:
```
Given an array of size n, find the majority element. The majority element is
the element that appears more than ⌊ n/2 ⌋ times.

You may assume that the array is non-empty and the majority element always
exist in the array.
```
#### Solution:
```python
def majority_element(nums):
  """This function returns the majority element from a list of ints.

  Time Complexity: O(len(nums))
  Space Complexity: O(1)
  """
  # This problem can be solved using the Boyer-Moore voting algorithm:
  # https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyer%E2%80%93Moore_majority_vote_algorithm
  count = 0
  for el in nums:
    if count == 0:
      majority_el = el
      count = 1
    elif el == majority_el:
      count += 1
    else:
      count -= 1
    return majority_el
```

### [Plus One][2]:
Jay presented this problem to Ha.
#### Problem Statement:
```
Given a non-negative integer represented as a non-empty array of digits,
plus one to the integer.

You may assume the integer do not contain any leading zero, except the number
0 itself.

The digits are stored such that the most significant digit is at the head of
the list.
```
#### Solution:
```python
def plus_one(digits):
  """This function returns the number, represented as a list of digits, plus 1.

  Time Complexity: O(len(digits))
  Space Complexity: O(len(digits)) but can be done in-place in O(1)
  """
  # Make a copy of digits.
  result = [el for el in digits]

  # Now, add 1 to results.
  for i in xrange(num_digits-1, -1, -1):
    if el < 9:
      result[i] += 1
      return result
    else:
      result[i] = 0

  # If we made it out of the for loop, that means
  # we have a carry of 1 left over.
  result.insert(0, 1)
  return result
```
