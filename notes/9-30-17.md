# Recap for 9-30-17:

## Attendees:
* Jay
* Keller
* Juan
* Ha

## Interview Prep:
This meeting was split into two halves:
### First Half:
* Keller showed us his approach to [problem 493][1] of Project Euler.
* We were unable to find the error in his approach.
* Looks like a good problem to tinker with, for fun, before the next
 meeting.

### Second Half:
* Did a mock interview using the [First Bad Version problem][2] from LeetCode.
  * Jay (interviewer)
  * Keller (interviewee-whiteboard)
  * Juan (interviewee-collaborator)
* This problem showed how important it is to have a problem solving process in
 place like the one mentioned in [CTCI][5]:

* Keller and Juan were able to come up with a solution but it was not
 asymptotically optimal in memory and it had some bugs.
* The solution was eventually reached and Keller had a great insight; he was
 able to quickly spot the proper update rules for the lower and upper bounds:
 ```
 lower = midpoint + 1
 upper = midpoint
 ```

## Miscellaneous:
* We had a discussion regarding `Python` and how it is neither call by reference
or call by value.
  - For more, see this [medium post][3].
* Juan told us about [Hacktoberfest][4].
  - Make 4 PRs on github during the month of October and you get a free shirt!

## Next Meeting:
* Juan will be presenting his solution to a problem he found interesting.
* Juan will be mock interviewed (whiteboard)
